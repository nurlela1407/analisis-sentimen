At least we have sympathy for their struggle by continuing to share the savagery of Israel and prayers to win the Palestinian people
so the conflict is called the fruit of inter-religious conflict for the Palestinian right to be free

"Yes, from the beginning, it wasn't a conflict in Israel, it's a secular country. Arab Muslims, the majority are Palestinians. The Jews and Christians have only been fried until here. It's a religious issue to collect donations. I don't know if it's arrived or not."
"It's not just about Christianity, Palestine is also often beaten by Israel, there are lots of digital footprints if you want to find a religious issue for sharing, because yesterday, the Al Aqsa Mosque was damaged, one of the triggers for the current hot conflict."

"In difficult conditions such as concentration camps, Israel's behavior retaliates, even though the impact on the settlements of the colonized residents is still reasonable. I am happy for Hamas to advance with rockets, the deterrent effect is that Palestine can be injured to the heart of Israel"
People are starting to appear pretentiously defending Israel and the Israel vs Palestine campaign is not a religious conflict for people who defend Palestine on a wrong religious basis
nothing worse than spit that speaks arabic but zionist heart he quipped Arabs themselves who are wrong in Hamas and palestine and silence with tyrannical zionist jews I also met someone like this who shouted independence but kept quiet
"To defend Palestine, of course we need to defend Palestine because there are many civilian victims and so is Israel, but to defend Hamas, which is a real terrorist, we need to rethink Hamas as a terrorist organization like the Papuan Family Planning Board."

"one needs funding, the other needs ex-arms exhibitionist, it's really a symbiotic mutualism between Hamas and Israel"
The Palestinian issue has always been a scene on news channels with a conflict curve that is almost traditional with simple solutions
"This issue is intended to attract sympathy from those who do not understand the real issue between Israel and Palestine, this issue is very sexy to attract sympathy because it can lead to religious conflict if the Papua issue has no impact on them."
"We support the struggle of the Palestinian people but we don't need to support the radical Hamas, you idiot. You hear, the attack is focused on Gaza and that is indeed under the Hamas administration and Hamas is indeed one of the militant groups with weapons."
"It's true that this is the Hamas conflict or the Palestine vs Israel conflict. Palestine is not only Gaza, the Palestinian people also work in Israel for the Israeli people. They also condemn the act of ordering in Palestine. Muslims living together with non-Muslims are strange."
"Israel-Palestine conflict in the eyes of the average or many Muslims and the media is the same analogy as Jakarta vs Papua in the eyes of the average human rights activist and the Israeli media or Jakarta just fart against Palestine or Papua then you will get great coverage, Mas Toto"

"But if you don't like Hamas, you'll definitely say you don't support Palestine, you support Israel, even though you've just seen an example now that Hamas is attacking Israel in vain because of the Iron Dome."
"The wrong point of view of Muslims themselves, who first became Jews and Christians, is like a group whose enemies are based on the Koran, the political conflict in Israel, Palestine, then becomes a conflict."
"It's too much to worship Hamas, if Allah Azza wa Jalla doesn't belong to any role in protecting Palestine, defending Palestine can only be done with effort, even though if you want to dismantle Hamas, it's only pretending to be the enemy of the Jews and defending Palestine."
"For some reason, I saw that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict was right as an attempt to prevent it from becoming the apocalypse because the prediction of the apocalypse had arrived, the conflict was over and what happened"
"It's because he likes to use Palestinian attributes, so every Palestinian issue people focus on religious conflict"
"Israel vs Hamas orders, I join you, purely a political conflict, so far the news has turned into a religious conflict as usual. What conflict is the biggest victim, Israel, Palestine?"
"Hamas is only looking for economic profit from the conflict they created, while Israel is helping Palestine sit down with the covid vaccine, so what are we doing with the Israeli Hamas conflict?"
"The conflict can be said to be the same if the cause is the same, but the Sampit case is different from the Poso case, especially the Palestine vs Israel case, we once expelled FPI during a direct conflict because they wanted to ride with the issue of religious sentiment."
"Hamas doesn't represent Palestinians at all, they control Gaza with propaganda and pressure"
"What the hell, people know the history of Hamas and how are relations with the Palestinian people, but yes, it's not Indonesia. The name if there are lots of verified accounts, it's stupid like Gin for fake articles."
"Israeli Jews are confused now that they are not only at war with Hamas, Palestine, but also war with the Lebanese Jordanian people, maybe Egypt will follow."
"The Hamas terrorist war with Israel, the Palestinian people is just a shield for Hamas' life"
"You really care about and care about the conflict between Israel and Palestine, your neighbors are having a hard time and are hungry, you just don't care about those who are far away and those who are close don't care"
"I really support the Palestinian people but please guys, don't be stupid, don't swallow all the news if you don't know what the Israel vs Palestine conflict is, I'm just joining the Zionist political conflict Israel vs Hamas, not between religions, Judaism vs Islam, must be smart"
"Maybe a corrupt country can do that, colonize, let us know that Hamas is corrupt and the Palestinian command is incompetent. What's the right relationship with colonizing and attacking Israel on Palestine"
"Hamas thinks that maintaining a crazy conflict, the Palestinians attack it while praying Tarawih quietly, that's wrong, Hamas thinks this time"
x Supporting Hamas is not a Palestinian state but pretending to support Palestine only with costumes
"The short axes who eat the narrative will be confused by the fact that there are Hamas who maintain war and fortunately there are those who are even more confused by the fact that there are orthodox Jews who actually support the Palestinians, the bad guys and the good guys in both."
"Or also the knot that if you have sympathy for the Palestinian condition, it's the same as supporting Hamas. This is really weird too"
"If I can say it's a good Israel vs Hamas conflict and the impact on the Palestinian people, I'm sorry if I can be wrong, OK?"
"the key is to stop the war, stop sending help for what to do to Palestine, it will be peaceful and Hamas will die by itself"
"still don't understand the motives for the conflict between Israel and Palestine, which in this era are still trapped by the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, I need to read it properly, see it from the point of view"
"Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian Christian who is good at diplomacy, doesn't compare himself to tens of thousands of stone-headed Hamas."
"I agree with this mother, I think it's clear that she stands up for the Palestinian people, if from the costumes and narrative she supports the Palestine Liberation Organization, try to find one that supports the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, the narrative is definitely different."
"That's not the logic of thinking, bro, dehumanizing Israel against Palestine is for a defense mechanism for the Palestinian people, which is marked by the formation of several organizations against one of Hamas, all Palestinians, the right to self-defense because of colonialism."
"Self-defense is necessary, but what Hamas is doing is bombing Israel with rockets and then protecting it behind civilian houses rather than making a basement above a Palestinian residence, it's the same as giving Israel time to attack Palestine"
"if you help stop the war, it might take a long time to run out of funds and eventually force a ceasefire"
"The suffering of the Palestinian people has led to the issue of the Hamas vs. Zionist conflict, so many understand that the Palestinians are victims and are stupid. Not one of them leads or knows that they live in Gaza. You are stupid."
"I'll repeat that the mechanism against Hamas is the same as before against the oppression of the system. I'll ask you, what is your theory in the problem of Hamas, that Hamas is Palestinians, what theory do you hold, humans, explain your theoretical perspective."
Diplomacy for Palestine and Israel is like hoping for an apple that can be picked from a starfruit tree
Palestinians are one with Hamas to defend their land
"If I have an opinion about the riots in Palestine and Israel, but with a different perspective from the general public, people will blaspheme, right?"
"Palestine vs Israel conflict since I was born, just like that, it never ends, which is a bit mod and I know it myself, Rizieq and the Yemeni gang here and also Ustadrun like Somad will open a pretend donation for Palestine but the ending is used for marriage in the morning, buying HD Rubicon etc."
Hamas and Israel are symbiotic mutualism or mutual benefit

"Palestine must be independent, bro, smartly, not using corpses, you support it when it's hot, bro, if you want to fight Hamas, just fly there, bring your family, bro"
Hamas and Israel mutualism symbiosis
Let's just say that yesterday just ceased arms from Intermezo
"there are so many analyzes that say that Hamas really doesn't care about the safety of the Palestinian people, they know very well that the rockets sent to Israel will not be of much use, but in fact they send too"
"the issue of religious conflict to brutally close Israel in the evil occupation of apartheid, fight for Islam, be patient, don't provoke it with suicide bombings, this method is not smart, it will make Islam bad name and end the issue of Palestine's transfer to Israel"

"Indonesia runs out of energy, even the collar is all strong, it won't change in Palestine and Israel, because it's the same thing against destiny, what else is it related to religion, because it's not Palestine vs Israel, but Hamas is the mastermind behind it all"
"If we discuss Hamas and Israel, the two of them will not finish with that person"
"I personally don't see the religion and faith of anyone who is a cruel victim of terrorists, indeed, the orders for intolerance and terrorism should be more urgent than the issue of Hamas and Israel."
"From the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, I mean the old United Nations didn't have a working function, it was just a meeting"
"the benefits for the Palestinian conflict today even though the conflict is called a pure state war between Palestine and Israel, namely Israel seizing land belonging to Palestine while Israel claims Palestinian land is land belonging to those who promised God"
"Let's join us, what happened between Palestine and Israel is not a conflict, so if the two sides belong to the same strong, while Israel belongs to the army and abundant weapons, of course, the United States can also support it."
"People who say that the enemies of Palestine and Israel don't care about us, please tell those who said that tomorrow, don't send any more peace troops to the United Nations because conflicts abroad don't concern us, the Jews."
I don't dare to talk about the history of Israel and Palestine because I don't have knowledge about that. What's clear now is that we ask the United Nations to be there so that the war can subside. Hamas and Israel are equally hard and no one wants to lose.
"What do you mean, the conflict in Palestine and Israel is not about religion but about humans, so if you don't want to care, just be quiet, you don't have to act like you know"
"General Purn Am Hendropriyono, Palestine and Israel conflict, not Indonesia, it's another matter for them, Arabs and Jews."
"We don't know for sure what happened there between Hamas and Israel, both Indonesia's attitude is not defending one but more towards the middle with other countries to think, encourage them to make peace and find a way out"
It's true that Palestine and Israel don't matter. The savage boss is Hamas. They purposely provoked them to disburse international funds and yesterday they bought weapons and they were arrested by the American Patrol who created the Hamas war.
"And I'm the person who says that Palestine and Israel are included in European organizations because if they join Middle Eastern organizations like Oki, the religious conflict will definitely get louder, Lord Rangga, this is a genius."
"let's defend the human crisis in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, just use human donations for the victims and pray so that this human crisis is quickly resolved and peace can exist between Palestine and Israel"
This is a war that is almost every year the pattern of provocation - Israel retaliates - Hamas attacks rockets - Israel responds with air strikes - ceasefire and then returns to the beginning again
Be careful the attitude of the conflict between Palestine and Israel must be wise and wise because Palestine has a role in I Indonesia being independent and in accordance with the Opening of the Indonesian Constitution of the year that Indonesia's commitment to colonize the world must be abolished
"The governor is too smart, Palestine, Israel, it's a territorial conflict, you don't have to bring it into the country, Indonesia can break up between supporters of Palestine and Israel, wow please stop this stupid"
"try to check on tiktok, fb, ig, twitter, etc. there are so many people who despise israel asking why they didn't catch them, let's play with logic, talk about this war between Hamas and israel, not palestine, this is taking over territory, not religion"
"How do they think that Hamas is defending Palestine as a victim and Israel is doing one thing, hating Israel, but Saudi Arabia's puja forgetting that the double standard yen doesn't work, I just have to say it's stupid"
"it's all just propaganda that defends Palestine, just looking for donations that defends Israel, doesn't have empathy for the Palestinian conflict and Israel is deliberately not having the good intentions of both parties and their allies to end the conflict for the people who are suffering and lead it prosperously"
"Sir, please free schoolchildren who are in prison because they insult Palestine. Don't just sit there, it's not fair, it's very unfair for the small people to be oppressed by the behavior of the Police."
"sorry if you don't go but with me it's a social sanction they get because for it because the conflict between Palestine and Israel is no longer about religion, it's a human problem"
"Indonesia's action for Palestine, I hope Mr. Hendropriyono knows this history that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been our care for a long time, West with Palestine, Free Palestine."
"United Nations, don't ignore the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, it's not about religion, it's about religion"
"If you want to know, first teach the history of Islamic etiquette, look for the beginning of the conflict between Palestine and Israel, that is the reason why many are defending in the name of religion, you know that the bombing of the Aqso Mosque, the Holy Land, was in Mecca and Medina, so it is still relevant."
"Israel's brutal action against Palestine has violated the right of Palestinians to live the UN must issue an announcement to stop attacking Palestine, the world has condemned the attack"
masya allah attacking israel has blindly invaded Palestine
"It's going to be over soon, the boss of the war against Israel, let alone alone, who is getting more and more victims, civilians and stubborn people, what are Palestinians and Israelis supposed to do with their ancestors, they really are brothers"
One thing that I think is true about Lord Rangga Sasana is that the Israel-Palestine conflict is not a religious war.
"State conflict won't end. What way does Indonesia work hard to help Palestine, it won't reduce conflict. Say no effect on supporting Indonesia to Palestine for Israel. It's just a waste of time. Indonesia is busy taking care of Palestine."
"As a matter of fact, Lord Rangga's statement about the Palestine-Israel conflict makes sense, they should negotiate peace and then enter the European Union, because if they enter the Middle East, the Arabian Peninsula countries will not want to."
"I feel sorry for the Palestinians who fought against Hamas and Israel, why did Palestine mention Hamas that the president had forgotten that he himself hates terrorists?"
"The order must be present on issues that are developing in Indonesian society regarding the conflict that has occurred between Israel and Palestine, scientific methods and international principles."
"Later, when the missiles run out, just ask for a ceasefire once the land of heaven and many people enjoy the donations who sell the suffering of living brothers and sisters, Ustad Harry Davidson"
Palestine free free Palestine
stupid victim that the israel-Palestine political conflict has become a religious conflict
The ceasefire is a condition for not disrupting Al-Aqsa and not attacking the area of Sheikh Jarrah and it is only a fragile and temporary ceasefire.
"Let's support Indonesia's command to help Palestine to become an independent country, not with donations, because it's only spoiled because the citizens themselves still need to pay attention, this is more or less like in Palestine, Syria and other conflict countries."
"O Allah, the almighty, the ever-living, eternal, victorious and free, Gaza, Alaqsa, Palestine, Allahu akbar"
"You are social climbing, we are like humans, we will definitely help Palestine, who is oppressed by humans, but for your gang, this is the right moment to take profit for your party for the sake of religion, even though everyone knows that the conflict there is not a religious war."
"Allah, protect and be strong, the Muslims in Palestine, O Allah, protect the Baitul Maqdis, O Allah, the free way to complete the land of Palestine from the Zionist occupation of Israel. La Natullah alaih"
"Let's pray together on behalf of humans, hopefully this conflict will soon subside Palestine Israel Jerusalem"
The most enemy party and considered a terrorist by the USA is ISIS in the Palestine Israel conflict
"what is the connection between the nation test and the israel palestine conflict, the nation test is a test of the soul of nationalism, love for Indonesia, homeland, not love for Palestine, if you are stupid, don't umbar"
So it appears that the Palestine-Israel conflict is not because of religion
So it appears that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is not because of religion but the power of land and evil over humans
"the truce period or the promise of peace is not just every second of war, so why do you only see the current situation, even though you still have interviews on TV and eat grinning photos?"
"And it is also necessary to understand that netizens who are trying to be honest understand that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not a religious conflict, it doesn't mean defending Israel and the Jews are straight."
"Mr. Am Hendropriyono's criticism is clear that the Palestine and Israel conflict is not about the Indonesian people. In my understanding, managing this conflict is managing foreign policy, which is a state road for PKS HTI, the community must be involved in a lot of excesses, I don't know what that means."
"identity politics, the benefits of the israel-Palestinian conflict to build solidarity"
I agree that at this time the Palestinian people need to help on behalf of humans
"I agree that currently the Palestinian people need help on behalf of humans, but don't lead opinions here and there."
"israel aggressor laknatullah Hamas is barbaric, the victims of women and children are like shields, while Hamas leaders live in luxury. Those who use the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for the personal gain of the group in what form are just rotten-hearted lies"
some parties outside the command are actually playing politics in this israel-palestine conflict community while the community is in conflict in this situation
"Some parties outside the command are actually playing politics in the israel-Palestinian conflict community, while the community conflict in this situation, Mr. Hendropriyono's criticism gets context."
"By supporting the conflict between Israel and Palestine, not supporting the American arms industry, I'm not sure"
free is insulting palestinian pig
"demand logically and in accordance with the root of the problem, but it will definitely be ridiculed if you ask for a ceasefire, saying that you have been victims, the people continue to call for peace, but if you don't offer a ceasefire, you will also use the people to be a shield for life, that's very pro-colonial"
"we go to Palestine like parents who are too supportive, support support but can't get a lot of moral support"
"like the American prawns, Israel, yes, allies, maybe in the draft, maybe Israel's allied countries can intervene directly in state conflicts and of course we already know which side, Palestine, will be like Libya, Iraq, so Russia, China"
israel aggressor cursed Hamas savage
"Kadrun's ultimate weapon, like it can be used to deal with the Palestine vs Israel conflict"
"I propose to Indonesia's order to be friends with Palestine and Israel so that they can be mediators of the conflict. There is no way for Indonesia to suggest peace to Israel, while we are enemies. We can only propose peace if we are at peace with all of this, a matter of objective logic."
"Yes, I'm going to Palestine vs Israel, it's not a religious conflict. The root of the problem also from the era of the leader, it's not a matter of religion, but it's about coming to drive the host away while pointing a gun at the host, fighting back in a perfunctory way."
I think Israel is hot because the Chinese media keep reporting on Israel attacking Gaza
This city became a crucial point of conflict because both Israel and Palestine both wanted Jerusalem as the capital of their country so that this city became the meeting point of the three religions which
"about gin, many people around me who are christian, both catholic and protestant, on average are more pro to israel even though it's true they don't really understand the conflict between israel and palestine"
"Allahu akbar, Palestine is free to send soldiers of the opponents of Israel, the caliphate of Palestine, the solution"
"Come on, I don't have to take care of Palestine anymore"

"I got an old general about the Palestine vs Israel conflict, it's not true, it's true that many don't aim and don't support it"

"Palestine free, let's pray together for Palestine"
"Palestine and Israel take care of humans, not monkeys"
"Palestine and Israel are all about humans, so let humans care about free Palestine"
Many Indonesians only see one side of Palestine in the Palestine vs Israel conflict and practice Israel versus Islam even though it's not a conflict. Call it not a religious conflict in war. Every action must be the same as civilian injuries in Israel. Many died and were injured.

"hit, don't give it slack, Allah swt is always the same as Hamas, Palestine, prayers and the spirit of Indonesian Muslims always hope to Allah, Hamas, Palestine, will win and free Palestine, all of that, hope for Moslems in Indonesia"

"do we understand how the international world sees the israel-Palestinian conflict, what is their solution?"
"That's not the Palestine vs Israel conflict, it's the Hamas conflict, the Muslim Brotherhood vs Israel. Support Jokowi as the President of the Republic of Indonesia, you don't have to support Hamas."
while still busy looking for sympathy through the Palestinian conflict with Israel
"the issue of Palestine has to end with independence because the ego of religion has dissolved into the case of Palestine, Palestine and Israel, like brothers and sisters who never get along cc"
"Indonesia loves peace, may peace be in Palestine and Israel, click to shine"
wars in this world are caused by people and very fortunately they are Israel-Palestine conflicts are also the same
"Does it relate to those who talk about the conflict between Israel and Palestine, don't deal with Indonesia, the word is to manage Israel and Palestine and Arab countries"

"The conflict between Palestine and Israel has now entered the stage of a ceasefire. We hope that this ceasefire can last for a long time for the sake of peace for the Palestinian and Israeli people, but maybe for a long time the political elite in the camp is still ego centric by sitting as a political leader."

sneaky nation just ceased arms
never believe in the jewish zionist ceasefire
It's good that the movement of one Hamas pin is better so that Indonesia doesn't scream for a ceasefire
The Palestinian-Israeli conflict is not a religious conflict. Religious sentiments in Indonesia create unhealthy polarization
The Palestinian-Israeli conflict is not a religious conflict. Religious sentiments in Indonesia create unhealthy polarization
cease fire because the rockets run out
the appeal between the sitting state and palestine in relation to the ceasefire is like kidnapping and holding hostages west with palestine israelterrorism
